## üöÄ Features

- Real-time hour, minute, and second updates

## üß† How It Works

- The JavaScript uses `setInterval` to update the time every second.
- Time values are converted to 12-hour format with leading zeros.
- SVG circles animate using `stroke-dashoffset` based on the current time.
- Dots are rotated using `transform: rotate()` for visual movement.
